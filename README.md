Data are averaged across pepper and frame.

The header of the .csv files should be self standing.

The matlab file EXTRACT_ALL_NEW_MT.m processes all data to analyse fixation duration, number of fixations, saccadic amplitue and saccadic speed. 

The file EXTRACT_SPREAD_ELLIPSES_REVISION.m processes all data for computing coverage and does the ANOVA.

The file MAKE_PAPER_ANOVAS_NEW_MT_ANALYSIS.m does the analysis for fixation duration, number of fixations, saccadic amplitue and saccadic speed - R must be installed.

The file EXTRACT_ALL_NEW_MT_SPLIT_TRIALS does the same analysis as the similar file above but splits the trials between the ones with the same or different objects.

The file MAKE_PAPER_ANOVAS_NEW_MT_ANALYSIS_SPLIT_SIGN_INT does the same analysis as the similar file above but splits the trials between the ones with the same or different objects.

The file EXTRACT_SPREAD_ELLIPSES_REVISION_SPLIT does the same analysis as the similar file above but splits the trials between the ones with the same or different objects.
